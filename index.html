<p>This year I have been working with a cohort of Graduate Research Fellows at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) at Stanford University. We have met regularly throughout the year at the laboratory environment of CESTA to explore new directions in digital humanities scholarship, and to workshop the design and development of our own research projects with presentations of work in progress. The Graduate Research Fellow Program cultivates intellectual engagement and critical understanding of technology and its influence in the construction of meaning, giving students the tools to problematize data structures and visual models of data. </p>

<p>One of my primary learning goals as a CESTA Fellow has been to aggregate and manage my research data with software, such that I can visualize and navigate the data with a web-based visualization platform Palladio (an NEH-funding project of Stanford’s Humanities + Design Lab) for use in my dissertation. I am approaching Palladio as a "gateway platform" to the digital humanities. It is easy and relatively intuitive to use: I have created a series of tabular data spreadsheets in Excel and look forward to uploading the data to create a new project. Once the project is created I can begin to explore a suite of methods that digital humanities researchers are working with at the moment: Maps, Timeline, Graph, Table, and Gallery views will allow me to see the multiple dimensions of my data. In other words, I can assess the geography and chronology of events, social networks, and other thematic relations in the data for insights into my research subject. Palladio is a gateway platform because these views may lead to the use of more advanced software to further develop one of these dimensions with methods better known to experts as spatial information design, network analysis, and topic modeling. </p>

<p>I am writing a dissertation on environmental and social issues in the work of late 20th century artists, drawing primarily from the archive of two collaborating California artists and university professors named Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison. The archive reveals a 50-year lineage of artistic research methodologies that inform and reappear in the work of contemporary artists who are intervening in the production of knowledge and in the search for solutions to environmental and social problems. Moreover, the archive dismantles environmental research and social research as discrete formations, and documents the artists' work to combine methodologies towards a deeper understanding of disciplinary norms and values, while also proposing new directions or approaches to knowing and making the world.</p>

<p>Stanford University Libraries (SUL) acquired the Harrison archive - a manuscript collection - in 2010 and began processing the archive in the fall of 2014 when Lucy Waldrop joined SUL Special Collections as the primary processing archivist (also funded by an NEH grant). Archival processing assistant Freya Channing is now wrapping up the last phase of processing to be completed this spring 2016. Establishing a good rapport both with the artists (who live in Santa Cruz) and with the SUL Special Collections staff, I have been able to observe and dialogue with Waldrop and Channing over the past several years. Furthermore, when they completed an Excel "container list" with metadata in substantially final form, they granted me permission to use the file as a template from which to design and build my own set of spreadsheets to develop a digital humanities project. In total, there is 230 linear feet of material in the Harrison archive, although the SUL staff joke that this two-dimensional metric is mostly useful for allocating storage space in shelving units, whereas the physical archive itself is multi-dimensional. There is a range of material organized into twenty "series" including, as specified on the SUL container list, the following:</p>

<p>Series 1: Personal/Biographical,
Series 2: Project Files (documentation of arts research),
Series 3: Project Binders (sheets of slide photography),
Series 4: Correspondence,
Series 5: Performances and Exhibitions,
Series 6: Presentations and Speeches,
Series 7: Early Work by Newton Harrison,
Series 8: Research,
Series 9: Business Records,
Series 10: UCSD,
Series 11: UCSC,
Series 12: Writings,
Series 13: Individuals,
Series 14: Public Relations Material,
Series 15: Printed Material,
Series 16: Photographic Material,
Series 17: Audiovisual Material,
Series 18: Computer Media/Born-digital,
Series 19: Art and Artifacts, and
Series 20: Restricted Material</p>

<p>For the past five months, I have gone weekly to the archive processing facilities in Redwood City to evaluate the materials and design my own Excel document to aggregate and manage the input of new metadata, drawing from materials in the archive, with the intention of visualizing the data in Palladio. One of the key decisions in designing this digital humanities project has been to narrow my focus from the 50-year span of the Harrisons' archive to the first decade of their collaboration - the 1970s. The innovation of their artistic research methodologies is particularly visible at that time, and close consideration of acclaimed projects like Survival  Pieces, Sacramento Meditations, and Lagoon Cycle will allow me to explore, among other things, how the artists established themselves as coequal partners in the creation of environmental and social art with a global worldview during a time when the art world systematically excluded women and generally underrepresented issues of gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity in its historical framework of cultural achievement. Moreover, narrowing the focus to the 1970s will allow me to bring forward lesser-known projects such as Body Bags and Meditation on the Gabrielino Indians to emphasize social justice as foundational to the Harrisons' career and inextricable from their commitment to environmental justice. I have chosen to manually comb through the archive to scrape it for metadata, instead of digitizing the material, and to focus primarily on Series 2: Project Files, although I have supplemented Series 2 with material from Series 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 11. </p>

<p>The container list for Series 2 includes 72 projects, however my adaptation of the list includes 31 projects. This smaller and custom subseries is designed to show the preconditions for arts research since the 1950s as well as its flashpoint in the 1970s. The earliest project dates to 1943 when Helen matriculated at Cornell University to begin a Bachelors degree in Psychology, and I describe their respective educational backgrounds as "projects" to include those early years as significant preconditions to the 1970s. The latest and longest project, Lagoon Cycle, dates from 1972 to 1987. Thus, the timeframe for my data is 1943 to 1987. My Excel document includes 12 spreadsheets with data for each of the 31 projects, organized as follows:</p>

<p>Primary Table,
Projects,
Places,
People,
Institutions,
Media,
Topics,
Science,
Politics,
Aesthetics,
Exhibitions and Performance, and
Acquisitions</p>

<p>My writing will build from visualizing these spreadsheets in Palladio, which is a flexible research platform. I am not driven by the need to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge about the Harrisons’ career as if to synthesize or contain it. Instead, I am using Palladio to discover conceptual and aesthetic patterns that may exist from one project to another, investigating how the Harrisons have advanced the notion of "arts research” in the fields of environmental and social art since the 1970s. </p>

<p>My ultimate aim with this dissertation is to provide a resource for my peers: to introduce and open the Harrisons archive to an experimental mode of next-generation thinking that I call “slow criticism” (to be elaborated in my dissertation). Through a close examination of the Harrison archive, focusing on their innovations in the 1970s, I will identify precise moments of collision, friction, entanglement, and liveliness in the action of art, in the action of knowing and making the world, such that contemporary artists who express their own desire to intervene in the production of knowledge and in the search for solutions to environmental and social problems can situate themselves historically and critically in a lineage of artistic research methodologies. Slow criticism is not driven by the need to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge about the Harrisons as if to synthesize, contain, and mythologize them as a singular art historical subject. Instead, I am attempting to navigate through the Harrisons’ archive as an open field of inquiry with many possible trajectories, frames, and outcomes. What does the archive reveal about the advancements and failures of arts research in the late 20th century?</p>
